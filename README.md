# DuckDB extension for Apache Iceberg 

This repository contains a DuckDB extension that adds support for [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/). In its current state, the extension offers some basics features that allow listing snapshots and reading specific snapshots
of an iceberg tables.

# Dependencies
## building
This extension has several dependencies. Currently, the main way to install them is through vcpkg. To install vcpkg, 
check out the docs [here](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html). Note that this extension contains a custom vcpkg port
that overrides the existing 'avro-cpp' port of vcpkg. The reason for this is that the other versions of avro-cpp have
some issue that seems to cause issues with the avro files produced by the spark iceberg extension.

## test data generation
To generate test data, the script in 'scripts/test_data_generator' is used to have spark generate some test data. This is 
based on pyspark 3.4, which you can install through pip. 

# Building the extension
To build the extension with vcpkg, you can build this extension using:

```shell
VCPKG_TOOLCHAIN_PATH='<path_to_your_vcpkg_repo>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake' make
```

This will build both the separate loadable extension and a duckdb binary with the extension pre-loaded:
```shell
./build/release/duckdb
./build/release/extension/iceberg/iceberg.duckdb_extension
```

# Running iceberg queries
The easiest way is to start the duckdb binary produced by the build step: `./build/release/duckdb`. Then for example:
```SQL
> SELECT count(*) FROM ICEBERG_SCAN('data/iceberg/lineitem_iceberg', ALLOW_MOVED_PATHS=TRUE);
51793
```
Note that for testing, the `ALLOW_MOVED_PATHS` option is available. This option will ensure some path resolution is performed. This
path resolution allows scanning iceberg tables that are moved, which is used during testing.

```SQL
> SELECT * FROM ICEBERG_SNAPSHOTS('data/iceberg/lineitem_iceberg', ALLOW_MOVED_PATHS=TRUE);
1	3776207205136740581	2023-02-15 15:07:54.504	0	lineitem_iceberg/metadata/snap-3776207205136740581-1-cf3d0be5-cf70-453d-ad8f-48fdc412e608.avro

```
For more examples check the tests in the `test` directory

# Running tests
## Generating test data
To generate the test data, run:
```shell
make data
```
Note that the script requires python3, pyspark and duckdb-python to be installed. Assuming python3 is already installed,
running `python3 -m pip install duckdb pyspark` should do the trick.

## Running unittests
```shell
make test 
```

## Running the local S3 test server
Running the S3 test cases requires the minio test server to be running and populated with `scripts/upload_iceberg_to_s3_test_server.sh`.
Note that this requires to have run `make data` before and also to have the aws cli and docker compose installed.
